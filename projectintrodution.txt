Introduction

The invention of GetYourSpace software was a turning point for many drivers. Especially throughout the major cities, where parking can be hard to find, for instance, in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver. This new software is used by drivers who use their cars for work or for daily errands and need an efficient way to find parking. Developed by Birpal B., Nelly G., Balwinder B. and Hrittik B., in Vancouver, BC, who frequently drive and wanted an efficient way to get parking quick and easy.
With over 3 million car owners in Vancouver, there is never enough public parking space. They are any parking restrictions throughout the city, either scheduled times, resident parking only, or strictly no parking. In a world where there is an average of over 150, 000 cars made daily, there should be an easier way to find and pay for accessible parking. GetYourSpace software was developed for drivers to find parking within their GPS location and when registering their licence plates, they’re easily charged based on how long they’ve been parked. This software is a blend of PayByPhone, which helps drivers pay for parking using an app, the internet or by calling. It provides other features that enable extensions to parking space through users’ phones. GetYourSpace software has similar features while adding GPS location option for users to easily find parking closer to their destination. As the software grows, we hope to see a decrease in city complaints, to allow for more public parking, and increase in user activity to ensure our software works efficiently.
This project will discuss the expenses and revenue to develop GetYourSpace software. It then describes the benefits of GetYourSpace software, including it’s current and future partnership to improve the software. Subsequently, it explores the wide-ranging effects of this software, across North America.
